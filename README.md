## Ryan Creamer Learning Journal

### About Me
Hi! my name is Ryan Creamer! I love sports and video games. I played soccer for 14 yaers, 4 of which were at the premier level. I also played baseball for 10 years and played select for 2 years, I have always been a very competative person and moved up in the levels of sports because of that. I also love play video games, I feel it is a good way to spend free tine and to be able to chat with friends  while I do so. I am taking this class to learn what it takes to become a software developer, and to hopefully end up with a developer job when i am finished with thesse courses.  

### What is Growth mindset?
To me growth mindset is being open to new challanges and learning how to work with them instead of avoing them. FOr example, I played soccer for most of my life and always thought i was better than the other kids i played with, however once i got to a level where kids were more skilled and athletic my abilities were not the best. Since these kids had played at a higher level for a long period of time i had to catch up to compete at the same level and instead of just being ok where i was at I needed to get better, **GROW!** So i kept the mindset that even if youre better than someone at a particular thing there is always someone one step ahead and you can always be better and grow your knowladge no matter what it is. 

### Always Remember!
1. To keep a growth mindset alwasy know that you are never the best at what you do even if it may seem that way, someone is always just that much better adn they only way to get there yourself is to keep working and keep learning.
2. Perservere! you will always face some sort of challange in life, and you just have to work with them, dont evrer let them hold you back from acomplishing something.
3. Always be wiling to learn from others, it can make a huge differance in how fast you can grow. 

### Day 2 Computer Setup
- Download Ubuntu and link it to my local machine
- Download and setup all addons for terminal
- get ready to use it to start using git 

### Day 3 ACP
- ACP stands for _Add_, _Commit_, _Push_
- Anytime you make a change to your code always ACP

#### ACP Reflections
- In class we learned the definition of ACP, as well how to do ACP through the terminal. Along with doing your ACP you shoud be running get status after every action. Once when you get all the way through you ACP and finish pushing through your code to the cloud, check your status one last time and it should have a block of code that will popup and generaly that means you did everything correctly.
